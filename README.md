# Twitter-Cyberbullying-Detection
Twitter Cyberbullying Detection is a Python-based project that uses sentiment analysis to detect instances of cyberbullying in tweets. This project reads a dataset of parsed tweets, analyzes their sentiment using the TextBlob library, and classifies each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. The processed dataset is then saved with an additional column indicating the sentiment of each tweet.
